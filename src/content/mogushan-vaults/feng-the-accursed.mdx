</Section>

<Section id="strategy" title="Strategy">
  <p>As for the order of the weapons, we will go for following: **Staff** >> **Spear** >> **Shield** >> **Fist**</p> <br/>

  <Section title="Tank Reminder">
    <p> As a tank, you have a special task given to you. At the start of the fight, there are 2 crystals you can choose from. The **right** one is for the maintank, the **left** one for the offtank.</p> <br/>
    <Mechanic title="Shroud of reversal (Left side)">
      Shrouds your **target** to mimic harmful abilities. Can be used to soak a spell and shoot it back at the boss. Is important for **Phase 4**.
    </Mechanic>
    <Mechanic title="Nullification Barrier (Right side)">
      Use that to nullify the damage from the boss abilities. It is channeled and looks like an AMZ on top of you.
    </Mechanic>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Phase 1 - Staff">
    <Phase title="Important spells">
      <SpellContainer>
        <Spell title="Arcane Resonance" image="/images/mogushan-vaults/feng-the-accursed/arcane-resonance.png">
          Arcane Explosion on everyone withing **6 yards**. Deals **20k** damage, but **increases the damage by 20k for each nearby player**.
        </Spell>
        <Spell title="Arcane Velocity" image="/images/mogushan-vaults/feng-the-accursed/arcane-velocity.png">
          Deals 70k damage per second, scaling based on how far you are away from the boss.
        </Spell>
      </SpellContainer>
    </Phase>

    <Phase title="Mechanics">
      <Mechanic title="Tank swap at 2 stacks">
        He stacks a debuff **Arcane Shock** on tanks, tank swap at 2 stacks to reduce damage taken.
      </Mechanic>
      <Mechanic title="Get Arcane Resonance - Run out!">
        If you get the debuff **Arcane Resonance**, you cast Arcane explosions on players withing 6 yds. Spread out. <br/>
        Since this is closely related to the **channeling AoE damage by** him, just **spread preemptively at the end of the channel**, so you don't wipe the raid.
      </Mechanic>
      <Mechanic title="Arcane Velocity - Stack on boss!">
        Around every **30 seconds**, stack on the boss, because he channels AoE damage, which does more damage, the further away you are from him.
      </Mechanic>
    </Phase>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Phase 2 - Spear">
    <p> Ranges stack in the center of the room. </p>

    <Phase title="Important spells">
      <SpellContainer>
        <Spell title="Wildfire Spark" image="/images/mogushan-vaults/feng-the-accursed/wildfire-spark.png">
          Gives you a debuff. After 5 seconds, drop fire on the ground. **Move to designated position**.
        </Spell>
      </SpellContainer>
    </Phase>

    <Phase title="Mechanic">
      <Mechanic title="Tank swap at 2 stacks">
        Same as before, just fire damage this time.
      </Mechanic>
      <Mechanic title="Get Fire Debuff - Run to staff position">
        If you get the debuff **Wildfire Spark**, run to the staff position and drop the debuff there. It will create fire on the ground.
      </Mechanic>
      <Mechanic title="Draw Flames - Don't stand in it">
        Every **30 seconds**, he draws the flame patches on the ground towards him. Melees don't stand between boss and flames. <br/>
        One he soaks the flames, he does AoE damage every **3 seconds**. <br/>
        The second time he uses **Draw Flames** - maintank uses **Nullification Barrier** to snuff out the fire before it reaches him.
      </Mechanic>
    </Phase>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Phase 3 - Shield (Heroic only)">
    <Phase title="Mechanic">
    <Mechanic title="Tank swap at 2 stacks">
        Again, this time just shadow damage.
      </Mechanic>
      <Mechanic title="Throw shield at the raid - Run out">
        Run out of the aoe, raid stacks at one position. Bomb the adds, before they reach the shield.
        Good spells to use: **Mass-Grip (DK)**, **Binding Shot (Hunter)**, all slows
      </Mechanic>
    </Phase>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Phase 4 - Fists">
    Before he reaches Phase 4, move him to the opposite side of the room, so it takes longer for him to pick it up. <br/>
    Positioning-wise, whole raid apart from 1 hunter stands behind boss and in melee range. Hunter stands in the center of the room.

    <Phase title="Important spells">
      <SpellContainer>
        <Spell title="Lightning Fists" image="/images/mogushan-vaults/feng-the-accursed/lightning-fists.png">
          Shoots 3 lightning balls in front of the boss. Hunter should soak it, when offtank has **Shroud of reversal** up.
        </Spell>
        <Spell title="Epicenter" image="/images/mogushan-vaults/feng-the-accursed/epicenter.png">
          150k aoe damage per second. Will be stunned by offtank, or soaked by maintank.
        </Spell>
      </SpellContainer>
    </Phase>

    <Phase title="Mechanic">
      <Mechanic title="Lightning fists - designated hunter soak, if offtank tells you to">
        Raid can ignore it. <br/>
        Hunter should soak it, and offtank has to channel his **Shroud of reversal** spell on him, while doing so. <br/>
        **Offtank:** keep that spell you have now on your **ExtraActionButton**, so you can stun him, while he casts his other ability.
      </Mechanic>
      <Mechanic title="Epicenter - Healers adjust">
        Can be interrupted by the offtank, if he soaked the **Lightning orb** correctly before. Just throw it on him while he is casting **Epicenter**. <br/>
        Second cast will be soaked by maintanks **Shroud of Nullification**. And then we go in turns. If someone messes up, just use raid cooldowns.
      </Mechanic>

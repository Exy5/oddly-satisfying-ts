    Spirit Kings consists of 4 bosses. <br/>
    Every time one boss is beaten, the following one will have an extra ability. Thus the last boss will have one of the abilities from each of the previous 3 encounters. <br/>
    What makes this even more complicated, the new boss will be active, once the current one reaches 30%.

    <Section title="Walkthrough">
      Basically, here's the important bits.
      <Mechanic title="Stand in front of him">
        Always stand in front of the boss, so his **Massive Attacks** does not wreck your tank.
      </Mechanic>
      <Mechanic title="Run through him, if he casts Annihilate">
        Closest way is the best. Run through him, if possible. Otherwise look where the tank is standing.
      </Mechanic>
      <Mechanic title="Priests Mass dispel the shield">
        Dispell the shield, and everyone else press **ESC** before the shield comes up.
      </Mechanic>
      <Mechanic title="Dodge the soldiers">
        Furthermore, he sends soldiers through the room, which swing their weapons on the way. Dodge that. <br/>
        **This is also the ability, that remains during the encounter.**

          Damaging him reduces your damage, healing and armor by 50%, if he is not stunned. <br/>

    <Section title="Walkthrough">
      Basically, here's the important bits.
      <Mechanic title="Ranges spread, so only 1 gets hit by rain of arrows">
        Spread nicely, so only 1 gets hit by the arrows. Then focus the arrow so the player does not take damage anymore. <br/>
        **BoP**, **Deterrence** can save lives. Also, priests **Life Grip**.
      </Mechanic>
      <Mechanic title="Dodge the volley">
        You shouldn't get hit more than twice by the volley.
      </Mechanic>
      <Mechanic title="If he casts Sleight of Hand, let the Rogue use Kidney Shot">
        That way, you don't get the debuff.
      </Mechanic>
      <Mechanic title="If he spins on your head, run out of the circle">
        That's also the ability, that will be taken over **Pillage**.

        Don't deal damage, before all stacks are gone.

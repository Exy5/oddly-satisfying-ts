    <Phase title="Important Spells">
      <SpellContainer>
        <Spell title="Touch of the Titans" image="/images/mogushan-vaults/elegon/touch-of-the-titans.png">
          Gain 50% damage and healing received. Also applies **Overcharged**, which increases your damage taken by 5%, stacking every 3 seconds.
        </Spell>
        <Spell title="Celestial Breath" image="/images/mogushan-vaults/elegon/celestial-breath.png">
          Breath on the tank. **Face him out of the raid**.
        </Spell>
        <Spell title="Total Annihilation" image="/images/mogushan-vaults/elegon/total-annihilation.png">
          Deals 500k dmg to the everyone **in line of sight**. Let it explode on the floor off the glass. <br/>
          **In Heroic 3 people need to soak the damage**.
        </Spell>
      </SpellContainer>
   	</Phase>
    <Phase title="Walkthrough">
      It's only a couple of mechanics to watch out for.
      <Mechanic title="Stand on glass, reset stacks around every 10 stacks.">
        Stand on the corner of the glass, so you need to do **minimal movement** to reset the stacks. <br/>
        Classes with defensive cooldowns can get more stacks for a better uptime.
      </Mechanic>
      <Mechanic title="Focus Adds whenever they are alive">
        Focus the add. Also applies healing debuff, which should be **Mass Dispelled**. On reaching **25% health**, it does raid wide damage. <br/>
        When it dies, casts **Total Annihilation**, which deals 500k raid damage to anybody in line of sight. <br/>
        Tank has to pull it off the glass, while the raid stands on the glass. <br/>
        **Furthermore, 3 people need to soak this spell, or the raid gets wiped in heroic mode.** After the explosion, the soakers need to be healed over 80%. <br/>
        Lastly, after soaking you get a debuff, so you can't soak again instantly. 2 Soak groups are required.
      </Mechanic>
    </Phase>

  <Section title="Phase 2 - kill Adds before they reach the generators">
    <Phase title="Walkthrough">
      <Mechanic title="Kill adds and damage boss">
        Kill all the adds, before they reach the generators on the edge of the glass. Next phase will start, once an add touches the generators. <br/>
        When the adds are down, damage the boss. The adds will spawn faster over time.<br/>
        Goal is to kill 6 waves, on the 7th we focus the boss instead for some more uptime.
      </Mechanic>
    </Phase>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Phase 3 - Kill the generators">
    When Phase 3 starts, he will get rid of the glass in the room. If that happens, the raid will split up onto the opposite sides of the room. <br/>
    Then you need to kill the generators.
    <Phase title="Walkthrough">
      After Phase 3 is done, the cycle will repeat again and we're back to Phase 1. 
      <Mechanic title="Dodge blue circles on the ground">
        Dodge them, or you will get oneshot. Furthermore they will spawn adds.
      </Mechanic>
      <Mechanic title="Cleave adds">
        Tanks pick those adds up, and cleave them next to the generators. Don't focus too much on those, but **prioritize the generators**. <br/>
        The adds will be cleaved down when we're back to Phase 1 anyways.

<Section id="intro" title="Introduction">
  Will of the Emperor is the final encounter in Mogu'shan Vaults. This one can only be done in Heroic, if **all other bosses have been slain in heroic as well**.
</Section>

<Section id="video" title="Video Guide">
  This will basically be the strategy we are opting for.

<Section id="types-of-adds" title="Types of Adds">
    Will of the Emperor is different in the sense, that it is not a single boss encounter, but instead you have to deal with adds accordingly. <br/>
    There are multiple adds, which are as follows, from small to biggest:
    <ol>
        <li>Emperor's Rage</li>
        <li>Emperor's Courage</li>
        <li>Emperor's Strength</li>
        <li>Jan-xi & Qin-xi</li>
    </ol>

    In the following sections we will look at the important spells for each add and how to deal with everyone, and then we go for a walkthrough. <br/>
    Also, I will highlight, what **Emperor's Rage** does, but we will opt for Joardee's strategy, where we just perma-cc them and ignore them basically.
  <Section title="General Stuff">
    <Phase title="General Spells">
      <SpellContainer>
        <Spell title="Titan Gas" image="/images/mogushan-vaults/will-of-the-emperor/titan-gas.png">
          Fills the room with gas, dealing 17k frost damage every second. Increases damage dealt by 25%.
        </Spell>
        <Spell title="Titan Spark (Heroic Only)" image="/images/mogushan-vaults/will-of-the-emperor/titan-spark.png">
          On death of *all* mobs, will spawn a titan spark. <br/>
          Fixates a random player and **die on contact with any player**, dealing 750k damage in an 8yrd radius. <br/>
          Needs to be soaked with **Deterrence**, **Cloak**, **Dispersion**, **Full Bubble** and the likes.
        </Spell>

  <Section title="Emperor's Rage">
		<Phase title="Important Spells">
      <SpellContainer>
        <Spell title="Focussed Assault" image="/images/mogushan-vaults/will-of-the-emperor/focussed-assault.png">
          Fixates on a player and only attacks that target.
        </Spell>
      </SpellContainer>
   	</Phase>
    <Phase title="How to deal with them">
      <Mechanic title="Perma root and CC them - ignore them">
        We just fully ignore them and CC them with **Mass Entanglement** *(Druid)*, **Frost Nova** *(Mage)*, **Binding Shot** *(Hunter)* and mass grip them back into place at times. <br/>
        The reason we do that, is because they also drop **Titan Sparks** on death, and that would be overwhelming.

  <Section title="Emperor's Courage">
		<Phase title="Important Spells">
      <SpellContainer>
        <Spell title="Half Plate" image="/images/mogushan-vaults/will-of-the-emperor/half-plate.png">
          Can only be damaged from behind. Can be snared.
        </Spell>
      </SpellContainer>
   	</Phase>
    <Phase title="How to deal with them">
      <Mechanic title="Designated players hit it from behind">
        They run to the tank that is **most far away** from the mob. If they reach said tank they reduce the armor, which will cause him to die from Jan-xi or Qin-xi. <br/>
        So just focus them, if you are assigned to deal with them. **Preferably melees!**
      </Mechanic>
    </Phase>

  <Section title="Emperor's Strength">
		<Phase title="Important Spells">
      <SpellContainer>
        <Spell title="Energizing Smash" image="/images/mogushan-vaults/will-of-the-emperor/energizing-smash.png">
          1.5s cast aoe on the ground with a ring indicator. 250k damage if hit.
        </Spell>
      </SpellContainer>
   	</Phase>
    <Phase title="How to deal with them">
      <Mechanic title="Designated player tank them - dodge the smashes">
        Their melee damage is weak, so you can tank it as a dps. You should tank them on the corners of the room, so the sparks, that spawn on their death, are far away. <br/>
        Priority target for **Ranges**!
      </Mechanic>
    </Phase>
	</Section>

  <Section title="Qin-xi and Jan-xi">
		<Phase title="Important Spells">
      <SpellContainer>
        <Spell title="Devastating Arc" image="/images/mogushan-vaults/will-of-the-emperor/devastating-arc.png">
          Strikes in a pattern, dealing 300k damage and reducing armor for **2 minutes**. They do that 10 times. <br/> 
          If you **dodge all 10** of them, you get an **ExtraActionButton** spell, that deals **1million damage**.
        </Spell>
      </SpellContainer>
   	</Phase>
    <Phase title="How to deal with them">
      <Mechanic title="Roll some tank CDs at all times">
        Roll a CD at all times, if possible, they should be the hardest hitting mobs. If you get hit by the combos, you're basically screwed.
      </Mechanic>
      <Mechanic title="Dodge the combos - deal damage">
        Just dodge the combos and deal damage, if nothing else needs attention. If you get hit by 3-4 slashes, you're a oneshot, so don't try to dance any further.
      </Mechanic>
    </Phase>

  <Section id="walkthrough" title="Walkthrough">
    <Mechanic title="Manage the adds">
      The adds have the **utmost priority**. **Kill your designated targets (Courage or Strength)**. <br/>
      They are the main reason your raid can wipe, if they are not managed correctly.
    </Mechanic>
    <Mechanic title="Soak the sparks">
      If you are a class that can soak them, do that, while nobody else is close to you. The explosion has a **8yrd radius**.
    </Mechanic>
    <Mechanic title="Manage the Emperor's Rage correctly">
      CC them correctly and keep them in their space. Grip them, if you are assigned. <br/>
      They **cannot** hit the raid, or it's basically a wipe.
    </Mechanic>
    <Mechanic title="Burn Jan-Xi and Qin-xi">
      There are some add down-times during the encounter, use your **Heroism** there. Burn them, whenever you have free time. <br/>
      And **Dance**, so you get the ExtraActionButton for damage.
    </Mechanic>

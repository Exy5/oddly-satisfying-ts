  <Phase title="Phase 1">
     <p>The boss consists basically of 1 Phase only and it's 2 mechanics we need to watch out for.</p>
     <br/>
    <Mechanic title="Color the tiles">
      Around the room, there are tiles on the ground (not under the carpet). Once a player stands on it, it gets enlightened and buffs the raid damage and healing.
      Pre-designated ranges walk around and color those tiles during the encounter.
      **At 75% and 40% HP the tiles reset and we need to paint them again.**
    </Mechanic>
    <Mechanic title="Stack and pray">As the name suggests. We place each other close to the stack point. Once the bosses reach 80+ energy, we stack on the stack point and throw cooldowns on top of each other.</Mechanic>
  </Phase>
